# Relationship

Relationship are integral part of GraphQL. It define how one entity integrate with another.

## Relationship Resolver

Relationship field (fields that are referencing other types) can be done using a relationship resolver, which is similar to any field resolver.

Say we have a type `Car` that have many `Part`s, where each `Part` holds the `id` for the `Car` it is for. 

```swift {11} showLineNumbers copy
import struct Pioneer.ID

struct Car: Identifiable {
    var id: ID
    var model: String
}

struct Part: Identifiable {
    var id: ID
    var name: String
    var carId: Car.ID
}
```

### Resolver on Object type

Using extensions, we can describe a custom resolver function to fetch the `Car` for a given `Part`, and getting all the `Part` for a given `Car`.

```swift showLineNumbers copy
extension Car {
    func parts(ctx: Context, _: NoArguments) async throws -> [Part] {
        try await ctx.db.find(Part.self).filter { $0.carId == id }
    }
}

extension Part {
    func car(ctx: Context, _: NoArguments) async throws -> User? {
        try await ctx.db.find(Car.self).first { $0.id == carId }
    }
}
```

<Callout type="warning" emoji="⚠️">
In a real producation application, this example resolvers are flawed with the [N+1 problem](#n1-problem).
</Callout>

And update the schema accordingly.

```graphql {4,10} showLineNumbers copy
type Car {
  id: ID!
  model: String!
  parts: [Part!]!
}

type Part {
  id: ID!
  name: String!
  car: Car
}
```

<Callout type="info">
This is an example how it would look like in [Graphiti](https://github.com/GraphQLSwift/Graphiti), this part is not restricted only to [Graphiti](https://github.com/GraphQLSwift/Graphiti).
</Callout>

```swift {11,17} showLineNumbers copy
import Graphiti
import Pioneer

func schema() throws -> Schema<Resolver, Context> {
    try .init {
        ID.asScalar()

        Type(Car.self) {
            Field("id", at: \.id)
            Field("model", at: \.model)
            Field("parts", at: Car.parts, at: [Part].self)
        }

        Type(Part.self) {
            Field("id", at: \.id)
            Field("name", at: \.name)
            Field("car", at: Part.car, as: Car?.self)
        }
    }
}
```

</details>

## N+1 Problem

Imagine your graph has query that lists items

```graphql copy
query {
  parts {
    name
    car {
      id
      model
    }
  }
}
```

with the `parts` resolver looked like

```swift filename="Resolver.swift" showLineNumbers copy
struct Resolver {
    func parts(ctx: Context, _: NoArguments) async throws -> [Part] {
        try await ctx.db.find(Part.self)
    }
}
```

The graph will executed that `Resolver.parts` function which will make a request to the database to get all items.

Let's assume the database is a SQL database and the following SQL statements created when resolving the query are:

```sql showLineNumbers copy
SELECT * FROM parts
SELECT * FROM cars WHERE id = ?
SELECT * FROM cars WHERE id = ?
SELECT * FROM cars WHERE id = ?
SELECT * FROM cars WHERE id = ?
SELECT * FROM cars WHERE id = ?
...
```

What's worse is that certain parts can be for the same car so these statements will likely query for the same users multiple times.

This is what's called the N+1 problem which you want to avoid. The solution? [DataLoader](#dataloader).

## DataLoader

The GraphQL Foundation provided a specification for solution to the [N+1 problem](#n1-problem) called `dataloader`. Essentially, dataloaders combine the fetching of process across all resolvers for a given GraphQL request into a single query.

The package [Dataloader](https://github.com/GraphQLSwift/DataLoader) implement that solution for [GraphQLSwift/GraphQL](https://github.com/GraphQLSwift/DataLoader).

```swift {1} showLineNumbers copy
.package(url: "https://github.com/GraphQLSwift/DataLoader", from: "...")
```

After that, we can create a function to build a new dataloader for each operation, and update the relationship resolver to use the loader

```swift {3-4,8-18,22-32} showLineNumbers copy
struct Context {
    var db: Database
    var carLoader: DataLoader<Car.ID, Car?>
    var partsLoader: DataLoader<Car.ID, [Part]>
}

extension Car {
    static func loader(ev: EventLoop, db: Database) -> DataLoader<Car.ID, Car?> {
        .init(on: ev) { keys in
            let cars = try? await db.find(Car.self).filter { keys.contains($0.id) }
            return keys.map { key in
                guard let car = cars?.first(where: { $0.id == key }) else {
                    return .succes(nil)
                }
                return .success(car)
            }
        }
    }
}

extension Part {
   static func loader(ev: EventLoop, db: Database) -> DataLoader<Car.ID, [Part]> {
        .init(on: ev) { keys in
            let all = try? await db.find(Part.self).filter { keys.contains($0.carId) }
            return keys.map { key in
                guard let parts = all?.filter({ $0.carId == key }) else {
                    return .success([])
                }
                return .success(parts)
            }
        }
    } 
}
```

<Callout type="warning">
It's best to create a loader for each operation as its cache will be valid only for that operation and doesn't create a **out-of-sync** cache problem on subsequent operations.
</Callout>

<Callout type="info">
[Dataloader](https://github.com/GraphQLSwift/DataLoader) have a method called `.loadMany` which takes multiple keys and return them all.
</Callout>

### Using dataloader in resolvers

```swift {3,9} showLineNumbers copy
extension Car {
    func parts(ctx: Context, _: NoArguments) async throws -> [Part] {
        try await ctx.partsLoader.load(key: id, on: ev)
    }
}

extension Part {
    func car(ctx: Context, _: NoArguments, ev: EventLoopGroup) async throws -> User? {
        try await ctx.carLoader.load(key: carId, on: ev)
    }
}
```

Now instead of having n+1 queries to the database by using the dataloader, the only SQL queries sent to the database are:

```sql showLineNumbers copy
SELECT * FROM parts
SELECT * FROM cars WHERE id IN (?, ?, ?, ?, ?, ...)
```

which is significantly better.
