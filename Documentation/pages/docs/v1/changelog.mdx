</Callout>

First stable release of Pioneer. Pioneer have been under [v0.x](https://github.com/d-exclaimation/pioneer/releases/tag/0.10.1) for a while and it has shown little major issues. This brings a bit more confidence for me to start introducing major improvements and changes.

## Motivation

One of the goal is to allow more Web frameworks integrations. Vapor is a great Web framework, but similarly to [Apollo Server](https://www.apollographql.com/docs/apollo-server/integrations/integration-index/), Pioneer should not strictly restrict itself to one framework. 
At some point (possibly **v2**), Pioneer and its Vapor integration would be separate packages which allow user of the library to use other options if they see fit.

Another goal is catch up to [Apollo Server v4](https://www.apollographql.com/docs/apollo-server/migration) which have significant changes especially on the API of the library.
