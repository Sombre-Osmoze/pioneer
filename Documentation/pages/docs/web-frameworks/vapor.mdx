# Vapor

Pioneer will have a built-in **first-party** integration with [Vapor](https://github.com/vapor/vapor). This aims to make developing with Pioneer faster by not having to worry about creating integrations for the most common option for a web framework in Swift.

This integration added a couple additional benefits.

```swift {15} showLineNumbers copy
import Pioneer
import Vapor

let app = try Application(.detect())

let server = Pioneer(
    schema: schema,
    resolver: Resolver(),
    websocketProtocol: .graphqlWs,
    introspection: true,
    playground: .sandbox
)

app.middleware.use(
    server.vaporMiddleware()
)
```

## Context

### HTTP-based Context

Pioneer provide a similar solution to `@apollo/server/express4` for building context using the raw HTTP requests and responses. It provide both in the context builder that needed to be provided when create the middleware.

<Callout type="info" emoji="⚡️">
This request and response will be request-specific / different for each GraphQL HTTP request.
</Callout>

```swift {16-18} showLineNumbers copy
import Pioneer
import Vapor

let app = try Application(.detect())

let server = Pioneer(
    schema: schema,
    resolver: Resolver(),
    websocketProtocol: .graphqlWs,
    introspection: true,
    playground: .sandbox
)

app.middleware.use(
    server.vaporMiddleware(
        context: { (req: Request, res: Response) in
            ...
        }
    )
)
```

#### Request (HTTP)

The request given is directly from [Vapor](https://github.com/vapor/vapor), so you can use any method you would use in a regular [Vapor](https://github.com/vapor/vapor) application to get any values from it.

```swift {2} filename="Getting a cookie example" showLineNumbers copy
func someCookie(ctx: Context, _: NoArguments) async -> String {
    return ctx.req.cookies["some-key"]
}
```

#### Response

The response object is already provided in the context builder that is going to be the one used to respond to the request. 

<Callout type="info">
You don't need return one, and instead just mutate its properties.
</Callout>

```swift {2-3} filename="Setting a cookie example" showLineNumbers copy
func users(ctx: Context, _: NoArguments) async -> [User] {
    ctx.response.cookies["refresh-token"] = /* refresh token */
    ctx.response.cookies["access-token"] = /* access token */
    return await getUsers()
}
```

### Websocket-based Context

[Vapor](https://github.com/vapor/vapor) integration also allow seperate context builder which is similar to what you can provide to the [`context`](https://github.com/enisdenjo/graphql-ws/blob/master/docs/interfaces/server.ServerOptions.md#context) property in [graphql-ws](https://github.com/enisdenjo/graphql-ws) where you are given the [Request](#request-ws), [Payload](#payload), and [GraphQLRequest](#graphqlrequest).

<Callout type="info" emoji="⚡️">
WebSocket context builder is **optional**. 

Pioneer's [Vapor](https://github.com/vapor/vapor) integration will try to use the HTTP context builder for WebSocket by providing all the relevant information into the [Request](#request-ws).
</Callout>

```swift {19-21} showLineNumbers copy
import Pioneer
import Vapor

let app = try Application(.detect())

let server = Pioneer(
    schema: schema,
    resolver: Resolver(),
    websocketProtocol: .graphqlWs,
    introspection: true,
    playground: .sandbox
)

app.middleware.use(
    server.vaporMiddleware(
        context: { (req: Request, res: Response) in
            ...
        },
        websocketContext: { (req: Request, payload: Payload, gql: GraphQLRequest) in
            ...
        }
    )
)
```


#### Request (WS)

The request given is directly from Vapor when upgrading to websocket, so you can use any method you would use in a regular Vapor application to get any values from it.

<Callout type="warning">
**Switching Protocol Request** <br/>
This request object will be the same for each websocket connection and will not change unless the new connection is made. <br/>
It will also not have **any custom headers** and the operation specific graphql query which is different from request given in HTTP.
</Callout>

```swift filename="Getting Fluent DB or EventLoop" showLineNumbers copy
struct Resolver {
    func something(ctx: Context, _: NoArguments) async -> [User] {
        return User.query(on: ctx.req.db).all()
    }
}
```


<details>
<summary> Changes to [Request](#request-ws) for shared context builder </summary>
<Callout type="info">
This is only for using 1 shared context builder, and not providing a separate WebSocket context builder.
</Callout>
The custom request will similar to the request used to upgrade to websocket but will have:

- The headers taken from `"header"/"headers"` value from the `Payload` or all the entirety of [Payload](#payload)
- The query parameters taken from `"query"/"queries"/"queryParams"/"queryParameters"` value from the [Payload](#payload)
- The body from the [GraphQLRequest](#graphqlrequest)

</details>

#### Payload

The connection params is given during websocket initialization from [`payload` as part of `ConnectionInit` message](https://github.com/enisdenjo/graphql-ws/blob/master/PROTOCOL.md#connectioninit) inside an established WebSocket connection.

<Callout type="warning">
Given that the `payload` parameter is custom each client, it does not have any strong typing, so you would have to work with `Map` enum.
</Callout>

```swift {2-3} showLineNumbers copy filename="Getting some values"
func someHeader(ctx: Context, _: NoArguments) async -> String? {
    guard .string(let token) = ctx.params?["Authorization"] else { ... }
    return token
}
```

#### GraphQLRequest

This is operation specific graphql request / query given an operation is being executed.

```swift {2-9} showLineNumbers copy filename="Getting operation type"
func someHeader(ctx: Context, _: NoArguments) throws -> String? {
    switch try ctx.gql.operationType() {
    case .subscription:
        ...
    case .query:
        ...
    case .mutation:
        ...
    }
}
```

### WebSocket Guard

There might be times where you want to authorize any incoming WebSocket connection before any operation done, and thus before the context builder is executed. 

Pioneer's [Vapor](https://github.com/vapor/vapor) integration provide a way to run custom code during the GraphQL over WebSocket initialisation phase that can deny a WebSocket connection by throwing an error. 

```swift {9-11} showLineNumbers copy
app.middleware.use(
	server.vaporMiddleware(
		context: { req, res in
			...
		},
		websocketContext: { req, payload, gql in
			...
		},
		websocketGuard: { req, payload in 
			...
		}
	)
)
```

## Handlers

Pioneer's [Vapor](https://github.com/vapor/vapor) also exposes the HTTP handlers for GraphQL over HTTP operations, GraphQL over WebSocket upgrade, and GraphQL IDE hosting.

This allow opting out of the middleware for integrating Pioneer and [Vapor](https://github.com/vapor/vapor), by manually setting this handlers on routes.

### GraphQL IDE hosting

[.ideHandler](https://swiftpackageindex.com/d-exclaimation/pioneer/documentation/pioneer/pioneer) will serve incoming request with the configured [GraphQL IDE](/docs/features/graphql-ide).

```swift {3} showLineNumbers copy
app.group("graphql") { group in
    group.get { req in
        server.ideHandler(req: req)
    }
}
```


### GraphQL over HTTP operations

[.httpHandler](https://swiftpackageindex.com/d-exclaimation/pioneer/documentation/pioneer/pioneer) will execute a GraphQL operation and return a well-formatted response.

```swift {3-8} showLineNumbers copy
app.group("graphql") { group in
    group.post { req in
        try await server.httpHandler(
            req: req, 
            context: { req, res in 
                ...
            }
        )
    }
}
```

### GraphQL over WebSocket upgrade

[.webSocketHandler](https://swiftpackageindex.com/d-exclaimation/pioneer/documentation/pioneer/pioneer) will upgrade incoming request into a WebSocket connection and start the process of GraphQL over Websocket.

```swift {3-11} showLineNumbers copy
app.group("graphql") { group in
    group.get("ws") { req in
        try await server.webSocketHandler(
            req: req,
            context: { req, payload, gql in
                ...
            },
            guard: { req, payload in
                ...
            }
        )
    }
}
```

## Additional benefits


The [Vapor](https://github.com/vapor/vapor) integration include other benefits such as:

- Includes all security measurements done by Pioneer automatically (i.e. [CSRF Prevention](/docs/features/graphql-over-http#csrf-and-xs-search))
- Automatically operation check for HTTP methods using the given [HTTPStrategy](/docs/features/graphql-over-http/#http-strategy)
- Extensions for `CORSMiddleware.Configuration` for allowing Cloud based [GraphQL IDE](/docs/features/graphql-ide)s
