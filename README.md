Pioneer is an open-source, [spec-compliant](https://github.com/d-exclaimation/graphql-http/blob/with-pioneer/implementations/pioneer-swift/README.md) GraphQL server that's compatible with any GraphQL schema built with [GraphQLSwift/GraphQL](https://github.com/GraphQLSwift/GraphQL). 

## Setup

```swift
.package(url: "https://github.com/d-exclaimation/pioneer", from: "1.0.0-beta")
```

## Swift for GraphQL

Pioneer is a layer on top of a web server for handling all GraphQL operations through HTTP and WebSocket utilising the new concurrency features in Swift 5.5.

It can work with any GraphQL schema built with [GraphQLSwift/GraphQL](https://github.com/GraphQLSwift/GraphQL) and work with any GraphQL client even with WebSocket.
